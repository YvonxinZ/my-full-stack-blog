hi! 很高兴见到你，这是我的个人博客，想用这个平台记录我在德国的生活和学习，想要记录中看环境如何塑造我。
回顾在中国的本科学习，发觉很多东西只是学了，考了，忽视了科目直接的关联，最后只是零零散散的学了很多，从本科高年级开始读是一次很好的机会让我去整合我的知识体系。
当然这个过程会很痛苦，我希望，现在在看博客的你，和我一起交流学习！来戳我吧~
Hi! I’m very happy to meet you. This is my personal blog, and I plan to use this platform to document my life and studies in Germany. I want to record how the environment here is shaping me.
Looking back at my undergraduate studies in China, I realized that I just learned and passed many things, often neglecting the connections between subjects. In the end, I only learned a lot of fragmented knowledge. Starting my studies here at a higher undergraduate level is a great opportunity for me to integrate my knowledge system.
Of course, this process will be painful. I hope that you, the person reading my blog right now, will join me in exchanging ideas and learning! Feel free to contact me!
